### Welcome to lamrop!
### this is a programming language with some simple functions:

### [there is an array, an integer for the array's pointer, an output string, and a storing variable (preset to 1) the moment you start.]

## Functions:

'l' - makes the array pointer go left. 

'a' - adds s to the number pointed to in the array.

'm' - subtracts s from the number pointed to in the array.

'r' - makes the array pointer go right.

'o' - displays the output string.

'p' - adds a new element to the right of the array (preset to 0).

's' - changes the stored variable's value to the number pointed to in the array.

'+' -

    if immediately followed by 'c', it adds the ASCII character equivalent of the number to the right of the output string.
    
    if not, it adds the number itself to the right of the output string.
    
Enjoy!
